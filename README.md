## 🗂️ Task Manager Application

This is a full-stack task management application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It enables users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks with a clean and intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

### 🔧 Key Features

- Add, update, and delete tasks
- Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks across columns
- **Implemented order divide logic** to maintain consistent task ordering during drag-and-drop operations
- Filter tasks based on status, priority, and due date
- Keyword-based task search
- Fully responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices

## 🚀 Deployed Application

- **Frontend:** [https://task-manager-frontend-0prx.onrender.com/](https://task-manager-frontend-0prx.onrender.com/)
- **Backend:** [https://task-manager-backend-bopy.onrender.com/](https://task-manager-backend-bopy.onrender.com/)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Since the application is hosted on Render's free tier, the backend service may go into an inactive state after periods of inactivity.  
> To ensure the app functions correctly:
> 1. Visit the backend link first: [https://task-manager-backend-bopy.onrender.com/](https://task-manager-backend-bopy.onrender.com/)
> 2. Wait 30-60 seconds for the backend to fully start.
> 3. Then access the frontend link to begin using the application.

### ⚠️ Single-User Limitation

This is currently a **single-user application**. If multiple people access the app simultaneously, changes made by one user may be visible to all others, as the state is shared.

---

### 🚀 Future Scope

- Add user authentication and authorization to support multi-user functionality and data isolation
- Role-based access control and persistent user sessions
- Integration with third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub)
